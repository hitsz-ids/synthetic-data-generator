The Synthetic Data Generator (SDG) is a specialized framework designed to generate high-quality structured tabular data. It incorporates a wide range of single-table, multi-table data synthesis algorithms and LLM-based synthetic data generation models.

Synthetic data, generated by machines using real data, metadata, and algorithms, does not contain any sensitive information, yet it retains the essential characteristics of the original data. There is no direct correlation between synthetic data and real data, making it exempt from privacy regulations such as GDPR and ADPPA. This eliminates the risk of privacy breaches in practical applications.

High-quality synthetic data can be safely utilized across various domains including data sharing, model training and debugging, system development and testing, etc. Read [the latest API docs](https://synthetic-data-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details!

## 🔧 Features

- Technological advancements
  - Supports a wide range of statistical data synthesis algorithms, LLM-based synthetic data generation model is also integrated;
  - Optimised for big data scenarios, effectively reducing memory consumption;
  - Continuously tracking the latest advances in academia and industry, and introducing support for excellent algorithms and models in a timely manner.
- Privacy enhancements
  - SDG supports differential privacy, anonymization and other methods to enhance the security of synthetic data.
- Easy to extend
  - Supports expansion of models, data processing, data connectors, etc. in the form of plug-in packages

### 🎉 LLM-integrated synthetic data generation

For a long time, LLM has been used to understand and generate various types of data. In fact, LLM also has certain capabilities in tabular data generation. Also, it has some abilities that cannot be achieved by traditional (based on GAN methods or statistical methods) .

Our `sdgx.models.LLM.single_table.gpt.SingleTableGPTModel` implements two new features:

#### Synthetic data generation without Data

No training data is required, synthetic data can be generated based on metadata data.

#### Off-Table feature inference

Infer new column data based on the existing data in the table and the knowledge mastered by LLM.

## 🔛 Quick Start

### Pre-build image

You can use pre-built images to quickly experience the latest features.

```bash
docker pull idsteam/sdgx:latest
```

### Install from PyPi

```bash
pip install sdgx
```

### Local Install (Recommended)

Use SDG by installing it through the source code.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hitsz-ids/synthetic-data-generator.git
pip install .
# Or install from git
pip install git+https://github.com/hitsz-ids/synthetic-data-generator.git
```

### Quick Demo of Single Table Data Generation and Metric

#### Demo code

```python
from sdgx.data_connectors.csv_connector import CsvConnector
from sdgx.models.ml.single_table.ctgan import CTGANSynthesizerModel
from sdgx.synthesizer import Synthesizer
from sdgx.utils import download_demo_data

# This will download demo data to ./dataset
dataset_csv = download_demo_data()

# Create data connector for csv file
data_connector = CsvConnector(path=dataset_csv)

# Initialize synthesizer, use CTGAN model
synthesizer = Synthesizer(
    model=CTGANSynthesizerModel(epochs=1),  # For quick demo
    data_connector=data_connector,
)

# Fit the model
synthesizer.fit()

# Sample
sampled_data = synthesizer.sample(1000)
print(sampled_data)
```

#### Comparison
