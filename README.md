# üöÄ Synthetic Data Generator

</p>
</div>

Synthetic Data Generator (SDG) is a framework focused on quickly generating high-quality structured tabular data. It supports more than 10 single-table and multi-table data synthesis algorithms, achieving up to 120 times performance improvement, and supports differential privacy and other methods to enhance the security of synthesized data.

Synthetic data is generated by machines based on real data and algorithms, it does not contain sensitive information, but can retain the characteristics of real data.
There is no correspondence between synthetic data and real data, and it is not subject to privacy regulations such as GDPR and ADPPA.
In practical applications, there is no need to worry about the risk of privacy leakage.
High-quality synthetic data can also be used in various fields such as data opening, model training and debugging, system development and testing, etc.

## üéâ Features

- high performance
  - SDG supports a variety of statistical methods, achieving up to 120 times faster execution speed, and reduces dependence on GPU devices;
  - SDG is optimized for large dataset, consumes less memory than other frameworks or GAN-based algorithms;
  - SDG will continue to track the latest progress in academia and industry, and introduce and support excellent algorithms and models in a timely manner.
- Rapid deployment in production environment
  - Optimize for actual production needs, improve model performance, reduce memory overhead, and support practical features such as single machine multiple cards, multiple machines multiple cards;
  - Provide technologies required for production environments such as automated deployment, containerization, automated monitoring and alarming, and support rapid one-key deployment;
  - Specially optimized for load balancing and fault tolerance to improve high availability.
- Privacy enhancements:
  - SDG supports differential privacy, anonymization and other methods to enhance the security of synthetic data.

Read [the latest API docs](https://synthetic-data-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.

## üîõ Quick Start

### Pre-build image

You can use pre-built images to quickly experience the latest features.

```bash
docker pull idsteam/sdgx:latest
```

### Local Install (Recommended)

At present, the code of this project is updated very quickly. We recommend that you use SDG by installing it through the source code.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hitsz-ids/synthetic-data-generator.git
pip install .
# Or install from git
pip install git+https://github.com/hitsz-ids/synthetic-data-generator.git
```

### Install from PyPi

```bash
pip install sdgx
```

### Quick Demo of Single Table Data Generation

```python
# Import modules
from sdgx.models.single_table.ctgan import CTGAN
from sdgx.utils.io.csv_utils import *

# Read data from demo
demo_data, discrete_cols  = get_demo_single_table()
```

Real data are as followsÔºö

[32561 rows x 15 columns]

```

```python
# Define model
model = CTGAN(epochs=10)
# Model training
model.fit(demo_data, discrete_cols)

# Generate synthetic data
sampled_data = model.generate(1000)
```
